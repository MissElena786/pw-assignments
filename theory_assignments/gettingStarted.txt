1.Why do we start learning a programming language with "Hello World!"?
The "Hello World!" program is a simple introductory program that is often the first thing beginners write in a new programming language. It is a basic program that outputs the phrase "Hello, World!" to the screen. This tradition serves as a way for beginners to become familiar with the syntax and structure of a programming language, ensuring that their development environment is set up correctly. It's a straightforward exercise that helps individuals grasp the fundamental concepts of writing, compiling, and executing code in a new language.


2.How is the use of comments, and how do you write comments in HTML?
Comments in programming serve as annotations within the code that are ignored during execution. In HTML, you can write comments using the following syntax:

html
<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->
Anything between <!-- and --> will be treated as a comment and won't be displayed on the webpage. Comments are useful for explaining code, making notes, or temporarily excluding code from execution.


3.What are elements, tags, and attributes, and what is the difference between them?

Elements: In HTML, elements are the building blocks of a webpage. They consist of tags and content and represent the structure of a document. For example, <p>Hello</p> is a paragraph element.
Tags: Tags are the HTML markup used to define elements. They come in pairs â€“ an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag begins the element, and the closing tag ends it. For instance, <p> is an opening tag, and </p> is a closing tag for a paragraph.
Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and are usually in name/value pairs. For example, in <a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>, "href" is an attribute that defines the hyperlink's destination.
Briefly explain what HTML entities are:
HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or characters that might not be easily typable on a keyboard. For example, &lt; represents the less-than sign ("<"), and &amp; represents the ampersand ("&"). HTML entities are essential for displaying reserved characters correctly in web pages without conflicting with the HTML markup.
