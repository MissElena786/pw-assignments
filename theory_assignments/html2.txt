1.Explain the table and its properties:
A table in HTML is created using the <table> element. It is used to organize data into rows and columns. Key properties include:

<tr>: Defines a table row.
<td>: Represents a table data/cell.
<th>: Represents a table header cell.
colspan and rowspan: Attributes to specify how many columns or rows a cell should span.
Example:

html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>


2.Explain all Media elements and how they work:
Media elements in HTML include <img> for images, <audio> for audio files, and <video> for video files. They work by specifying the source (src) attribute to link to the media file. Example:

html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
